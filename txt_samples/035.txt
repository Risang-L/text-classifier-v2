What I know is, when we study in America, there are many opportunities to change our lives, especially if we study at one of the best places in the world, namely Stanford University, even though there are many challenges, such as language differences and it also requires very high costs studying there, but the facilities provided are also commensurate with the costs, it's just how do we manage our finances and also manage our time to be efficient when studying there.
