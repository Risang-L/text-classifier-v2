My presentation was on the history of American dance. There are many styles of dance in America, such as ballet, tap, hip hop, and contemporary. I learned about American culture through their dance traditions. Famous dancers in America include Fred Astaire, known for his elegant tap dance, and Misty Copeland, a groundbreaking ballerina. My sister admires Fred Astaire's style, saying, "His dance is timeless and graceful." I think so too. Other renowned dancers are Michael Flatley, Alvin Ailey, and Martha Graham.
