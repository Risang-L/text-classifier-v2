What I know about the topic of my presentation is that the word ethnicity comes from the word "ethnos" which means group or community, ethnic characteristics can come from the same culture, language, ancestry or history. Some of the ethnicities that I know in America are Hispanic American, Asian American, African American, and Middle Eastern.
