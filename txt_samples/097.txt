What I know from the topic that my group is discussing is about Australian society in the world of entertainment (movies) which discusses how the world of cinema in Australia can reflect major changes such as in the social, cultural and political fields on the people/population of Australia, the role played to shape the identity of Australian films with its impact on the representation of the diversity of existing works, the influence of the production, distribution and consumption of Australian films with globalization and technology, how to deal with existing issues especially in the social, political and cultural fields and the extent to which Australian national identity is reflected, and what are the consequences of the representation of the cultural diversity of Australian cinema for global understanding.
