What I know from my group presentation material is that group 10 on American environmental issues consists of several parts. The first is about the history of environmental movements starting from the early 20th century. The American environmental movement has become one of the most influential globally, with notable figures such as Rachel Carson, Al Gore, and David Attenborough. Some initiatives that have made an impact include the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the establishment of national parks. And for environmentalists in America, there are many prominent ones like John Muir, Jane Goodall, and Bill McKibben. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the environmental world relies on roles such as researchers, activists, and policy makers.
