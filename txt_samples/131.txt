In American society, the concept of "Other Ethnicity" encompasses a wide range of cultural backgrounds outside of dominant racial categories. These groups make significant contributions to America's rich culture. For example, individuals of Middle Eastern, South Asian, or Pacific Islander descent may face stereotypes and discrimination rooted in ignorance or geopolitical tensions. Additionally, the concept of “Other Ethnicity” highlights the complexity of identity. Despite these barriers, the presence of Other Ethnicities enriches American society by fostering cross-cultural understanding, challenging stereotypes, and encouraging inclusivity. Efforts to recognize and celebrate diversity in the “Other Ethnicity” category are essential to fostering a more just and dynamic society.
