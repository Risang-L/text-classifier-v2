What I know about the topic of my presentation is about American society and campus life and activities. America has many famous campuses, and education is also very good from school to college. Students in America are very smart in various academic and non-academic fields. The campuses in America also have very good rankings, and also have students who come from outside. American universities have very good and adequate facilities, one of which is a dormitory where students can live in dormitories. The people in America are very kind and friendly, and have a very diverse culture.
