Native American societies have long served as stewards of the environment, embodying principles of sustainability and respect for the natural world. Their traditional ecological knowledge has guided practices such as rotational farming, which promote soil health and biodiversity. Moreover, Indigenous communities have led efforts to protect vital ecosystems, advocating for the preservation of sacred lands and the conservation of wildlife habitats. In the face of climate change, their holistic approaches to land management offer valuable insights for sustainable resource use and resilience-building strategies. By recognizing and incorporating Indigenous perspectives into environmental policies and practices, society can work towards a more harmonious relationship with the planet and learn from the wisdom of Native American cultures.
