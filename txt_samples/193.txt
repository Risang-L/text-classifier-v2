American drama has evolved significantly over the centuries, transforming from a relatively non-existent art form to a prominent and influential part of English literature. Initially, the Puritan influence in New England led to a ban on theatrical performances, and most early American drama was imported from Europe. However, with the American Revolution and the Early National period, drama began to reflect the changing climate of the new country, with plays like Mercy Otis Warren's "The Adulateur" (1773) and John Leacock's "The Fall of British Tyranny" (1776) serving as political satires or propaganda to support the revolutionary cause. As the 20th century progressed, American drama continued to diversify, with notable playwrights like Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams making significant contributions to the art form. Their works, such as O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey into Night" (1941), Miller's "Death of a Salesman" (1949), and Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1947), explored themes of disillusionment, the human condition, and the struggles of the working class, cementing American drama's place in the broader literary landscape. Today, American drama continues to be characterized by its realism, social relevance, and psychological complexity, with playwrights tackling contemporary issues like race, gender, and politics, ensuring its continued influence on English literature.
