My presentation was on the history of American art. There are many styles of art in America, such as abstract, realism, and pop art. I learned about American culture through their art movements. Famous American artists include Andy Warhol, known for his pop art, and Jackson Pollock, renowned for his abstract expressionism. My friend admires Andy Warholâ€™s work, saying, "His art is vibrant and iconic." I think so too. Other renowned artists are Georgia O'Keeffe, Roy Lichtenstein, and Edward Hopper.
