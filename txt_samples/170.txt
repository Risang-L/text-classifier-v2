American drama is a rich and vibrant art form that reflects the country`s diverse history and social landscape. Early American plays were often influenced by European models, but they gradually developed a distinct identity. Playwrights like Eugene O'Neill explored themes of alienation and the American dream, while Arthur Miller tackled social issues like capitalism and the common man. In the latter half of the 20th century, American drama became even more diverse, with the rise of feminism, African American theater, and LGBTQ+ voices. Today, American drama continues to be a powerful platform for social commentary and entertainment.
