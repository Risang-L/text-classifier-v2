The United States or commonly known as Uncle Sam's country is one of the developed countries that can match the big countries in Europe such as Russia which is also a developed country. The progress of this country we can see especially from the field of machine technology such as luxury vehicles that are certainly many plastered on the streets or on the corners of the road. In the transportation industry, of course, America is also no less competitive with European countries, including in the field of personal transportation. Moreover, the US government is also very concerned about road infrastructure, especially with the increase in private vehicles which also encourages the government to always facilitate everything so that traffic rules remain on the rules and reduce all kinds of obstacles or risks that might occur, especially on the highway.
