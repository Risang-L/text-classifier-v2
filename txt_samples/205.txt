There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private education sector, types of private schools, and the difference between private and public schools. The private education sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of institutions controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide quality education for a fee. Entities that form the private education sector include independent schools and private universities. Next is the difference between private and public schools. Public schools are funded and operated by the government, while private schools are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
