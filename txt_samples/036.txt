What I know about the topic of my presentation is that my group's topic is discussing campus life in America, where campus life there is of course different from here because of the different culture, of course. There are many differences between campus life there and here, starting from complete campus facilities, experienced lecturers, as well as many organizations there, and finally, sports or extracurricular activities on American campuses can be said to be quite popular to follow, such as American football.
