There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private comic book industry, types of private comic book publishers, and the difference between private and public comic book publishers. The private comic book industry is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of publishers controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide quality comic book content for a fee. Entities that form the private comic book industry include independent publishers and major comic book companies. Next is the difference between private and public comic book publishers. Public comic book publishers are funded and operated by the government, while private publishers are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
