My presentation was on the history of American animation. There are many styles of animation in America, such as traditional, stop-motion, and computer-generated. I learned about American culture through their animation traditions. Famous animators in America include Walt Disney, known for his classic animated films, and Tim Burton, renowned for his unique style. My friend admires Walt Disney's creations, saying, "His animation has a magical quality." I think so too. Other renowned animators are Hayao Miyazaki, Brad Bird, and Chuck Jones.
