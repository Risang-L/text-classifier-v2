Native Americans, also referred to as American Indians or Indigenous Americans, are the descendants of the original inhabitants of the Americas. They arrived in North and South America over 15,000 years ago, long before European contact. These diverse groups developed rich cultures with unique languages, traditions, and political systems. Some well-known groups include the Inuit of the Arctic, the Pueblo people of the Southwest, and the Cherokee of the Southeast. Though facing hardships due to colonization and forced assimilation, Native American communities continue to thrive and preserve their heritage. Their languages are still spoken, their art forms continue to inspire, and their stories are essential to understanding the history of the Americas.
