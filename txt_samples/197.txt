Native American tribes, often referred to as aboriginal peoples or native Americans, are ethnic and cultural groups that have inhabited the American mainland for thousands of years before the arrival of European explorers. Their cultural diversity includes unique traditions, languages, and spiritual beliefs. Before European colonization, these tribes developed complex social, economic, and political systems, with societies organized in different structures, such as confederations, federations, or tribal nations. They also develop a deep knowledge of their natural environment and practice sustainable farming techniques, such as swidden agriculture, that respect natural cycles and the existence of other living things. Additionally, their cultural contributions to art, music, and folklore have become an integral part of the United States' cultural heritage. Although their history is often marked by conflict and oppression, the existence and cultural heritage of Native American tribes remains an important part of the United States' national identity.
