There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private tech sector, types of tech companies, and the difference between private and public tech firms. The private tech sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of companies controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide technological solutions for a profit. Entities that form the private tech sector include startups and tech giants. Next is the difference between private and public tech firms. Public tech firms are listed on stock exchanges and regulated by the government, while private tech firms are privately owned and managed.
