What I know about my presentation topic is that the term "space exploration" refers to the discovery and exploration of celestial structures. American space exploration has a rich history, reflecting technological advancements and scientific discoveries. Some notable milestones I know are the Apollo moon landings, Mars rover missions, and the Hubble Space Telescope.
