American music is a vibrant tapestry woven from the sounds of a multicultural nation. European influences like folk melodies met the rhythmic pulse of West African drumming brought by enslaved people, birthing genres like blues and jazz. This foundation continued to evolve as immigrants from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia brought their own musical traditions. The 20th century saw American music take center stage globally, with genres like country, rock and roll, and hip-hop finding fans all over the world. This rich musical legacy continues to inspire and innovate, with contemporary American music reflecting the ever-changing demographics of the country.
