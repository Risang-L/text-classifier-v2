For American citizens, public transportation is very supportive for every citizen or community of course with a special program so that their citizens can get any discount or tariff they want. Besides, as we know that America is a country free of firearms on sale so this is a new challenge for the National Infrastructure Security Committee of the U.S. Department of Transportation so every public transportation must improve its security like implementing scanners and detectors to respond to bio-terrorist attacks or accidents.
