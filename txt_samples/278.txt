My presentation was on the history of American literature. There are many genres of literature in America, such as fiction, poetry, and drama. I learned about American culture through their literary works. Famous American authors include Mark Twain, known for his novels, and Emily Dickinson, renowned for her poetry. My teacher admires Mark Twainâ€™s writing, saying, "His stories capture the essence of American life." I think so too. Other notable authors are F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Toni Morrison.
