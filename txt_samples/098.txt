What I know about my material is about university life in Australia, where Australia is one of the places that has good and good quality education at the international level. There is also something I know about how to live while studying in Australia, we can study while working part time, we can also look for various sources of scholarships because there are many scholarships, and there the lecturers or teaching staff really support their students in any way. The recommended good universities in Australia are the University of Melbourne, one of them.
