What I know from the topic of my presentation is that Sherlock Holmes is one of the most ICONIC fictional characters in his genre, the Sherlock Holmes novel has a ton of mysteries to solve and each mystery has a different way of solving the case, this is what makes the novel interesting to read, this novel It also has the right setting for the genre and theme which makes this novel very exciting to read. Even now, there are still many people in America who like to read Sherlock Holmes novels, even adapting them into films. And of the films that have been adapted, in my opinion the best film is the film Sherlock Holmes, played by robert downey jr.
