What I know from my group presentation material is that group 5 on American science fiction consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American science fiction starting from the early 20th century. The American science fiction tradition has become one of the most influential in the world, with notable figures such as Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, and Ursula K. Le Guin. Some works that have changed science fiction include "Foundation," "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and "The Left Hand of Darkness." And for writers in American science fiction, there are many great ones like Arthur C. Clarke, Harlan Ellison, and William Gibson. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the science fiction world relies on roles such as editors, publishers, and literary agents.
