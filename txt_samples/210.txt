My presentation was on the history of American photography. There are many styles of photography in America, such as portrait, landscape, fashion, and documentary. I learned about American culture through their photography traditions. Famous photographers in America include Ansel Adams, known for his stunning landscape photography, and Dorothea Lange, who documented the Great Depression. My friend admires Ansel Adams's work, saying, "His photos are breathtaking and timeless." I think so too. Other renowned photographers are Annie Leibovitz, Diane Arbus, and Robert Frank.
