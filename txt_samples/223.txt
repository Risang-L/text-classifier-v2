There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private construction sector, types of private construction companies, and the difference between private and public construction. The private construction sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of companies controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide quality construction services for a fee. Entities that form the private construction sector include independent contractors and private construction firms. Next is the difference between private and public construction. Public construction is funded and operated by the government, while private construction is funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
