My group's topic is about private sector spesifically private sectors in America, private sectors from my understanding are individual owned companies/properties with no government involved in it with the intention to make profit, They create a lot of jobs, which helps people make a living, and they also pay taxes that go towards things like schools and roads, common examples that i could think of are retails, food companies and even famous brands such as apple and microsoft.
