My presentation was on the history of American jazz. There are many styles of jazz in America, such as bebop, swing, and smooth jazz. I learned about American culture through their jazz traditions. Famous jazz musicians in America include Louis Armstrong, known for his trumpet skills, and Duke Ellington, renowned for his compositions. My grandfather admires Louis Armstrong, saying, "His trumpet playing is unparalleled." I think so too. Other renowned jazz musicians are Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane.
