The American public relies heavily on transportation infrastructure to navigate daily life. From bustling urban centers to rural communities, transportation networks facilitate the movement of goods and people, enabling economic activity and social connectivity. In cities, public transit systems such as buses, trains, and subways serve as lifelines for millions, offering affordable and efficient ways to commute to work, school, and leisure activities. Moreover, the interstate highway system connects regions across the country, facilitating the flow of commerce and supporting industries such as logistics and tourism. However, challenges such as aging infrastructure, congestion, and environmental concerns highlight the need for continued investment and innovation in transportation to ensure accessibility, sustainability, and equity for all Americans.
