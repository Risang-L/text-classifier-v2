My presentation was on the history of American space exploration. There are many milestones in space exploration in America, such as the Apollo moon landing, the Mars rover missions, and the Hubble Space Telescope. I learned about American culture through their space achievements. Famous space missions include Apollo 11, known for landing the first humans on the moon, and the Voyager probes, renowned for their journey to the outer solar system. My cousin admires the Apollo 11 mission, saying, "It was a monumental achievement for humanity." I think so too. Other notable missions are the Space Shuttle program, the International Space Station, and the James Webb Space Telescope.
