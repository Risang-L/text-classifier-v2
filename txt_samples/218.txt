What I know from my group presentation material is that group 3 on American theater consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American theater starting from the colonial period. The American theatrical tradition has become one of the most influential in the world, with notable figures such as Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and Lorraine Hansberry. Some works that have changed theater include "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Death of a Salesman," and "A Raisin in the Sun." And for playwrights in American theater, there are many great ones like August Wilson, Neil Simon, and Sam Shepard. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the theatrical world relies on roles such as directors, producers, and stage managers.
