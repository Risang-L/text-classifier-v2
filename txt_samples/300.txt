There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private festival sector, types of private festivals, and the difference between private and public festivals. The private festival sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of organizations controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to organize festivals for a fee. Entities that form the private festival sector include music festivals and cultural events. Next is the difference between private and public festivals. Public festivals are funded and operated by the government, while private festivals are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
