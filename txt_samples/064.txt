So, what I know about the topic my group brought up, namely American Society Entertainment (Movies). We know that the American film industry is very well known throughout the world, therefore, the American film industry is the main center of global film production and has a great influence in American Society. In the world of American cinema, there are various film genres and have created a celebrity culture that influences the lifestyles and perceptions of people throughout the world, especially in America. American films also often reflect and reinforce American cultural values, and address American social and political issues.
