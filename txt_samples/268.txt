What I know from my group presentation material is that group 8 on American wildlife consists of several parts. The first is about the history of wildlife conservation starting from the early 20th century. The American wildlife conservation movement has become one of the most influential globally, with notable figures such as John Muir, Rachel Carson, and Theodore Roosevelt. Some conservation efforts that have made a difference include the creation of national parks, wildlife reserves, and endangered species protection programs. And for biologists in American wildlife, there are many prominent ones like Jane Goodall, E.O. Wilson, and Roger Tory Peterson. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the conservation world relies on roles such as wildlife managers, researchers, and educators.
