What I know from my group presentation material is that group 7 on American innovations consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American inventions starting from the early 20th century. The American innovation landscape has become one of the most influential globally, with notable figures such as Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk. Some inventions that have changed the world include the light bulb, the personal computer, and the electric car. And for inventors in American innovations, there are many prominent ones like Nikola Tesla, Henry Ford, and Mark Zuckerberg. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the innovation world relies on roles such as engineers, designers, and researchers.
