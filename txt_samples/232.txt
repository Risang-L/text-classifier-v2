There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private science fiction publishing sector, types of private publishers, and the difference between private and public publishers. The private science fiction publishing sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of publishers controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide quality science fiction works for a fee. Entities that form the private science fiction publishing sector include independent publishers and private press companies. Next is the difference between private and public publishers. Public publishers are funded and operated by the government, while private publishers are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
