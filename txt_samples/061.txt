In my group presentation material, the topic is music. From the word music we can take the view as entertainment, hobby, or learning for some people. As for the presentation material, there are American music and Australian music. For me, these 2 things have differences, perhaps in their characteristics, musical character, or traditions. Each country, be it America or Australia, is a place where many artists or singers have interesting talents and characteristics in performing their music.
