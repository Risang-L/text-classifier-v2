What I know from my group presentation material is that group 9 on American sports consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American sports starting from the early 20th century. The American sports scene has become one of the most dynamic in the world, with notable figures such as Michael Jordan, Serena Williams, and Tom Brady. Some events that have changed sports include the Super Bowl, the NBA Finals, and the World Series. And for athletes in American sports, there are many famous ones like LeBron James, Tiger Woods, and Simone Biles. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the sports world relies on roles such as coaches, referees, and sports agents.
