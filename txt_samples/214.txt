There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private theater sector, types of private theaters, and the difference between private and public theaters. The private theater sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of theaters controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide quality entertainment for a fee. Entities that form the private theater sector include independent theaters and private production companies. Next is the difference between private and public theaters. Public theaters are funded and operated by the government, while private theaters are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
