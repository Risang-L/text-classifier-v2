My presentation was on the history of American cinema. There are many genres in American cinema, such as action, drama, and comedy. I learned about American culture through their films. Famous American directors include Steven Spielberg, known for his blockbusters, and Martin Scorsese, renowned for his dramatic films. My cousin admires Steven Spielbergâ€™s work, saying, "His movies are iconic and entertaining." I think so too. Other notable directors are Quentin Tarantino, Alfred Hitchcock, and Francis Ford Coppola.
