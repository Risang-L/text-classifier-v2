There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private sports sector, types of private sports organizations, and the difference between private and public sports entities. The private sports sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of organizations controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to provide sports entertainment for a fee. Entities that form the private sports sector include professional sports teams and private sports clubs. Next is the difference between private and public sports entities. Public sports entities are funded and operated by the government, while private sports entities are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
