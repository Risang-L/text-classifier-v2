I got the slide on the part of giving examples of private transportation, which in that part I displayed an RV. RV stands for Recreational Vehicle. By using this type of car, users can recreate in beautiful parts of America, without having to worry about things like beds, toilets, kitchens, and others. While explaining, I gave my friends a nostalgic look at the game GTA San Andreas, which if they had played, they would have noticed this type of RV vehicle in the villages. Apart from RVs, my friends also discussed modern cars, such as the Ford Mustang, and others. Also discussed was the event that is always held, which is Cruise Night and Car Show. And finally, we was explained how the government regulates private transportation in American Society.
