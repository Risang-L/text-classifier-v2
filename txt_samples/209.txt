What I know from my group presentation material is that group 2 on American literature consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American literature starting from the colonial period. The American literary tradition has become one of the most influential in the world, with notable figures such as Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Some works that have changed literature include "Moby-Dick," "The Great Gatsby," and "To Kill a Mockingbird." And for authors in American literature, there are many great ones like Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison, and Stephen King. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the literary world relies on roles such as editors, publishers, and literary agents.
