What i know from my group presentation material is that group 1 on america movies cosist of several parts, the first of which is about history starting from the early 20th century. The american film industry has become one of the largest in the world, with hollywood as its center. Then came some movies that i think have changed the movies industry cuch as Star wars, Titanic, and Avatar. And for actors in american cinema also of course consist of very great actors, such as Johhny depp, Brad pitt, Leonardo dicaprio and many others. And of course behind all the points that i have mentioned of course the world of cinema will not run without some important roles behind it alll, such as directors, screenwrites,cameraman and producers to.
