For my presentation on American society life, the topic I chose is Mobility (Public Transportation). The content I cover includes the history, types, benefits, challenges, social role, and innovation in public transportation in the US. The first discussion is the long history of public transportation, starting in the 19th century with toll roads, and continuing to evolve alongside the development of railroads, private cars, buses, trams, and bicycle lanes. The benefits include cost savings, environmental protection as well as comfort and safety for the American people.
