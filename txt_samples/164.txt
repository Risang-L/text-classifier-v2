The United States boasts a love affair with private transportation, especially cars. This dependence stems from a unique combination of historical development and cultural values. The vast American landscape, coupled with post-war federal investment in the interstate highway system, encouraged car ownership and suburban living. Culturally, the car is seen as a symbol of freedom, independence, and social mobility. This private vehicle dependence has a profound impact on American society. It facilitates a dispersed population with lower density living, but also contributes to urban sprawl, traffic congestion, and a decline in investment in public transportation options. This car-centric society not only shapes physical landscapes but also influences social interactions, with many daily errands and leisure activities revolving around personal vehicle use.
