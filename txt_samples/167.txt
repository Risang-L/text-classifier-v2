The private sector is the non-government part of the economy. Businesses of all sizes, from shops to corporations, are owned by individuals and aim to make a profit (or serve a cause for non-profits). This sector drives innovation, creates jobs (90% in developing countries!), and is a key piece of the economic engine.
