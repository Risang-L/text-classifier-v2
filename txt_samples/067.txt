Because in the presentation group I delivered material about theater drama, here I can understand what the difference is between drama and theater. which according to my understanding of drama, depicts a human being with his movements through dialogue in battle. Meanwhile, theater, human behavior involves more dialogue, acting and is more related to artistic forms.
