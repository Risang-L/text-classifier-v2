My presentation was on the history of American fashion. There are many styles of fashion in America, such as casual, formal, streetwear, and high fashion. I learned about American culture through their fashion traditions. Famous designers in America include Ralph Lauren, known for his classic American style, and Vera Wang, renowned for her bridal collections. My cousin admires Ralph Lauren's designs, saying, "His style is timeless and elegant." I think so too. Other renowned designers are Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, and Donna Karan.
