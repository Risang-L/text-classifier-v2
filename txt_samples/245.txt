What I know from my group presentation material is that group 6 on American comic books consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American comic books starting from the early 20th century. The American comic book tradition has become one of the most influential in the world, with notable figures such as Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Will Eisner. Some comic book series that have changed the industry include "Spider-Man," "Batman," and "Watchmen." And for creators in American comic books, there are many great ones like Frank Miller, Neil Gaiman, and Alan Moore. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the comic book world relies on roles such as artists, writers, and editors.
