In this exam I will only discuss what I understand from the topic "public transportation challenges in America" according to the material I presented during the presentation So after I read several articles that discussed the challenges faced by America regarding public transportation, I understood that the challenges they faced were also faced by Indonesia, there are several points such as "culture" from the article I read, Americans are used to using private vehicles to travel and this creates new problems such as traffic jams and air pollution. Of course, traffic jams and air pollution are also one of the biggest problems in Indonesia, one of which is in the city of Makassar. This happens because the majority of Indonesian citizens prefer to use private vehicles compared to using public transportation.So, from that first point I asked why Americans prefer to use private transportation, and this is answered in several subsequent challenges such as funding for public transportation, access to public transportation and security... the lack of funding for public transportation facilities makes these facilities impossible. poorly maintained, apart from that because the large population is not comparable to the number of public transportation, people end up using private vehicles. This is also felt in our country, Indonesia. And the last one is the issue of security, this is a problem faced not only in America and Indonesia but in almost every country in the world, because public transportation can be accessed by many people, many crimes can occur when using public transportation. , such as sexual harassment, robbery. etc. This is from my personal understanding, sorry if it's too long, thank you sir.
