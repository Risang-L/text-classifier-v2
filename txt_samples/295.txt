What I know from my group presentation material is that group 11 on American technology consists of several parts. The first is about the history of technological advancements starting from the early 20th century. The American tech industry has become one of the most influential globally, with notable figures such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. Some innovations that have changed the world include the personal computer, the internet, and smartphones. And for technologists in American technology, there are many prominent ones like Tim Berners-Lee, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the tech world relies on roles such as developers, engineers, and innovators.
