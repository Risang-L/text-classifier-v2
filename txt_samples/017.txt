What I know about my group's material (American Book) is that books are a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images. Books also consist of many pages, bound together and wrapped in a book cover. The type of book is divided into 2 types, namely fiction books and non-fiction books. Fiction books contain imagination and fantasy while nonfiction contains facts. Some American book publishers are such as Hypercollins, Macmilan Ins and so on, and examples of American books such as The Da Vinci Code, In His Steps and so on.
