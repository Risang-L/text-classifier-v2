Despite these challenges, Native American communities have consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Many Native American groups developed complex societies with their own governments, laws, and cultural practices. For example, the Iroquois Confederacy, which was formed in the 16th century, was a powerful and influential government that operated for over two centuries.
