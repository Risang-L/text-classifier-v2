My presentation was about American food. There are many types of food in America, such as burgers, pizza, tacos, and hot dogs. I learned about American culture through their food. Famous American dishes include the cheeseburger, known for its juicy beef patty, and apple pie, famous for its sweet taste. My aunt loves apple pie, saying, "Itâ€™s a classic American dessert." I think so too. Other popular foods are buffalo wings, mac and cheese, and barbecue ribs.
