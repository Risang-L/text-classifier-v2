There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private wildlife sector, types of private wildlife organizations, and the difference between private and public wildlife conservation. The private wildlife sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of organizations controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to preserve wildlife for a fee. Entities that form the private wildlife sector include independent wildlife reserves and conservation nonprofits. Next is the difference between private and public wildlife conservation. Public wildlife conservation is funded and operated by the government, while private conservation is funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
