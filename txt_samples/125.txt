Native Americans, also known as Native American tribes, have a rich and diverse cultural heritage that has shaped the history and identity of the United States. They have maintained their traditions, language and spiritual beliefs for thousands of years, making important contributions to the country's cultural diversity. Tribes such as the Navajo, Lakota, Cherokee, and many others enriched society with their art, music, and traditional wisdom. However, the history of indigenous peoples is also marked by injustice, including exile from their ancestral lands, loss of culture, and unequal access to health and education services. Raising awareness and efforts to improve relations between native tribes and the government have been an important focus in efforts to achieve reconciliation and strengthen Native American communities.
