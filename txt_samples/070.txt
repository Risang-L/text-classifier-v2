What I know from my group's presentation is that drama theater is one type of drama performance that is staged on stage to convey various stories, emotions, and conflicts. Drama theater also uses movements, facial expressions, and stage settings so that the story below is more alive. So, I think theater plays are like witnessing a life story on stage that can make us laugh, cry, or even reflect.
