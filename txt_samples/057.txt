Ok, here I will explain a little regarding the topic of the presentation that I did previously. The title of the presentation that I have delivered is about "The Development of Music in America". Before entering into the discussion, we need to know what is music? So, music is an art that produces sounds regularly. The supporting elements of music are sound, vocals or instrumentals which are later combined to form music. Well, as is known, America is a country that has various types of music genres which have spread to various corners of the world. The music genres that first appeared in America include jazz, pop, hip-hop, rap, country, rock & roll and many more. Of course, this music has a function which is very useful for us (music lovers). We can use music as entertainment, a tool to express culture which is the identity of a country, and can be used to express emotions. Of course, America definitely had music figures who were very popular at that time, one of the American music figures that I know was Elvis Presley who worked in the rock and roll music genre. One of his songs that was a hit at that time was "Heartbreak Hotel" and "Love Me Tender". So, in essence, the music genres in America have their own uniqueness, and over time these music genres have developed and even gone global.
