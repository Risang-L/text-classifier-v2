My presentation was on the history of American dance. There are many styles of dance in America, such as hip-hop, ballet, and jazz dance. I learned about American culture through their dance traditions. Famous American dancers include Martha Graham, known for modern dance, and Fred Astaire, renowned for his ballroom dance. My teacher admires Fred Astaireâ€™s performances, saying, "His dance style is timeless and graceful." I think so too. Other notable dancers are Alvin Ailey, Isadora Duncan, and Gene Kelly.
