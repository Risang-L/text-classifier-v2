What I know from my group presentation material is that group 4 on American architecture consists of several parts. The first is about the history of American architecture starting from the colonial period. The American architectural tradition has become one of the most influential in the world, with notable figures such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, and Philip Johnson. Some buildings that have changed architecture include Fallingwater, the Willis Tower, and the Guggenheim Museum. And for architects in American architecture, there are many great ones like I.M. Pei, Zaha Hadid, and Norman Foster. Of course, behind all the points I mentioned, the architectural world relies on roles such as urban planners, interior designers, and landscape architects.
