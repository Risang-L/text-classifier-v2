There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private environmental sector, types of private environmental organizations, and the difference between private and public environmental efforts. The private environmental sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of organizations controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to address environmental issues for a fee. Entities that form the private environmental sector include conservation nonprofits and environmental consultancies. Next is the difference between private and public environmental efforts. Public environmental efforts are funded and operated by the government, while private efforts are funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
