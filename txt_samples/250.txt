There are some points I know about my presentation material, namely the understanding of the private historical preservation sector, types of private historical organizations, and the difference between private and public historical preservation. The private historical preservation sector is part of the economy not run by the government. It consists of organizations controlled by individuals and private groups aiming to preserve historical artifacts and sites for a fee. Entities that form the private historical preservation sector include independent museums and private historical societies. Next is the difference between private and public historical preservation. Public historical preservation is funded and operated by the government, while private preservation is funded and managed by individuals or organizations.
